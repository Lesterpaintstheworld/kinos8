As a user, I want to connect my wallet using /connect command so that I can verify ownership\n   - Bot generates unique message to sign: 'KinKong verification {random_uuid}'\n   - User signs with Solana wallet via sign.solana.com\n   - Bot verifies signature using @solana/web3.js\n   - Bot stores wallet address and Telegram ID in users.json\n   - Success message shows verified wallet address\n   - Error message prompts to try again if verification fails\n\n2. As a user, I want to check my subscription status using /status command\n   - View connected wallet address (first 4 + last 4 chars)\n   - See current USDC balance from Helius API\n   - Check subscription status (active if balance >= 1,000 USDC)\n   - View last profit distribution amount and date\n   - Show error if wallet not connected\n\n3. As a user, I want to subscribe by sending USDC\n   - Minimum 1,000 USDC requirement\n   - Transfer to KinKong wallet (FnWyN4t1aoZWFjEEBxopMaAgk5hjL5P3K65oc2T9FBJY)\n   - Helius webhook monitors for incoming transfers\n   - n8n workflow filters transfers >= 1,000 USDC\n   - Welcome message includes portfolio tracking link\n   - Store subscription date and amount in database\n\n### Portfolio Management\n4.

As an admin, I want to detect market opportunities\n   - Focus on top 5 AI tokens by market cap\n   - Trade only during uptrends defined by:\n     * 20-day moving average positive slope\n     * RSI between 40-70\n     * Increasing volume trend\n   - Maximum 3 positions at once with:\n     * 2% max position size\n     * 5% stop-loss per trade\n     * 15% take-profit targets\n   - Strict stop-loss implementation:\n     * Automated execution\n     * No manual overrides\n     * Immediate order placement\n\n### Technical Implementation\n8. As a developer, I want to implement USDC transfer monitoring\n   - Helius webhook configuration:\n     * Endpoint: /webhook/transfers\n     * Filter: USDC token only\n     * Minimum amount: 1,000 USDC\n   - n8n workflow steps:\n     1. Receive webhook data\n     2. Extract sender address\n     3. Verify amount >= 1,000\n     4. Update subscriber database\n     5. Trigger welcome message\n   - Automatic subscriber updates:\n     * Store subscription timestamp\n     * Record transfer amount\n     * Update user status\n     * Send confirmation\n\n9. As a developer, I want to implement secure data storage\n   - Store user data in JSON format:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"telegramId\": \"string\",\n       \"walletAddress\": \"string\",\n       \"subscriptionDate\": \"ISO-8601\",\n       \"lastDistribution\": {\n         \"amount\": \"number\",\n         \"date\": \"ISO-8601\",\n         \"txHash\": \"string\"\n       },\n       \"status\": \"active|inactive\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - Track wallet addresses with verification status\n   - Monitor subscription dates for reporting\n   - Record all distributions with transaction hashes\n\n## Technical Components\n\n### Whale Tracking System\n- Real-time transaction monitoring\n- Large holder analysis\n- Movement pattern detection\n- Alert system\n\n### Market Opportunity Detection\n- AI token market analysis\n- Trend identification\n- Entry/exit point calculation\n- Risk assessment\n\n### Risk Management Protocols\n- Position size limits\n- Stop-loss automation\n- Portfolio diversification rules\n- Exposure management\n\n### Portfolio Optimization Tools\n- Performance analytics\n- Risk-adjusted returns\n- Rebalancing automation\n- Distribution calculations\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n1.
