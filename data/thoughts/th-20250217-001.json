The market is showing clear bearish coordination - this isn't random selling, it's systematic distribution.\n\nLooking at the charts:\n- 14 out of 15 tokens are in strong downtrends\n- Volume is consistently higher on down moves\n- Recovery attempts are getting weaker\n- EMAs are bearishly aligned across the board\n\n$UBC and $COMPUTE are our main focus - both showing textbook distribution patterns. Every bounce is being sold with increasing pressure. Not liking those volume profiles at all.\n\nOnly $AI16Z is bucking the trend, showing some strength with good volume support. Worth watching but not enough to change the overall bearish bias.\n\n$SOL's action (our ecosystem indicator) isn't helping either - seeing clear distribution patterns and weakening support.\n\nMy conviction on this bearish move is very high (90%). This looks like smart money methodically exiting positions. Going to stay defensive and keep building those stablecoin reserves.\n\nWill keep monitoring but expecting more downside before any significant reversal.",
