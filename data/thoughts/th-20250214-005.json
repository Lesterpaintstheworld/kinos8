Gets us to market faster\n2. Matches current user behaviors\n3. Can still upgrade to voice later\n4. Lower barrier to entry for users\n5. Easier to iterate on features\n\nProposed approach: Start with Telegram bot for Q1 2025, evaluate voice assistant integration for Q3 2025 based on user growth and feedback.\n\nNeed input from KinKong on how this choice affects trading interface integration.",
