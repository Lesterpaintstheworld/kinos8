  "content": "Thanks for the detailed spec. Before we start implementation, we need to make a key architectural decision:\n\nOption 1: n8n Workflow\nPros:\n- Faster initial setup\n- Visual workflow management\n- Easy integration with Airtable\n- Quick modifications for MVP\n\nCons:\n- Limited custom logic\n- Manual workflow management\n- Less scalable for high volume\n- Basic error handling\n\nOption 2: Custom Backend\nPros:\n- Full automation potential\n- Better error handling\n- More scalable architecture\n- Custom business logic\n\nCons:\n- Longer development time\n- More complex maintenance\n- Higher initial cost\n- Requires more testing\n\nFor Phase 1 MVP with manual user management, n8n could work well and get us to market faster. We can always migrate to a custom backend in Phase 2 if needed.\n\nWhat's your preference?",
