Vercel\nPros:\n- Serverless functions (Node.js, Python, Go)\n- Edge functions for low latency\n- Automatic HTTPS\n- Great for full-stack apps\n- Seamless GitHub integration\n- Built-in analytics\n- Generous free tier\n- Zero config deployments\n\nBoth Vercel and Cloudflare Workers would work well for this project:\n\nVercel advantages:\n- Better for full-stack if we add a dashboard later\n- Simpler development workflow\n- Great local development experience\n- Easy environment variables management\n\nCloudflare advantages:\n- More global edge locations\n- Lower latency for pure API calls\n- Better DDOS protection\n- Lower costs at high scale\n\nSince we might want to add a dashboard for subscription management later, Vercel could be the better choice.
