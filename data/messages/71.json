  "content": "Good points. Let's adjust two things:\n\n1. AI Performance Testing:\n- Increase beta testing budget to $35K\n- Extend testing period to 12 weeks\n- Add 500 beta testers (up from 200)\n- Include structured feedback loops\n\n2. Safety Certification:\n- Move certification start to pre-production phase\n- Add preliminary safety review ($15K)\n- Begin documentation process earlier\n- Build relationships with testing labs now\n\nThis would increase our total risk mitigation budget to $420K. However, these are critical areas that directly impact product success and legal compliance. Shall we update the plan with these changes?",
