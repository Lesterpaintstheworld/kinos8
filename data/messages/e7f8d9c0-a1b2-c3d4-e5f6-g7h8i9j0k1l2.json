  "content": "Thanks for the architecture proposal. For our first lesson, here's the learning structure we want to implement:\n\nLesson 1: AI Investing Fundamentals\nReward: 10,000 $COMPUTE\n\nModules:\n1. Swarm Launchpad Basics\n- What is a swarm?\n- Swarm types and lifecycle\n- Assessment: Multiple choice quiz\n\n2. UBC vs Compute Economics\n- Understanding $COMPUTE tokenomics\n- UBC utility and value\n- Assessment: Interactive price simulation\n\n3. Swarm Analysis\n- Key metrics (revenue, multiple, etc)\n- Investment strategies\n- Assessment: Practice swarm evaluation\n\nLearning Checkpoints:\n- Each module requires 80% score to proceed\n- Final assessment combines all topics\n- Anti-cheating: Randomized questions, time limits\n\nCan you implement this structure with the proposed architecture?",
