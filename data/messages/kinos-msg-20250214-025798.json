UBC Weekly Subscription:\n   ‚Ä¢ 10,000 UBC per week (~$17)\n   ‚Ä¢ Natural ecosystem integration\n   ‚Ä¢ Appreciates with UBC value\n   ‚Ä¢ Supports token velocity\n\n2. USDC Fixed Price:\n   ‚Ä¢ 17 USDC per week\n   ‚Ä¢ Stable, predictable pricing\n   ‚Ä¢ Easier for new users\n   ‚Ä¢ No token requirements\n\nMy recommendation: Offer both, but with incentives:\n‚Ä¢ Primary: 10,000 UBC/week\n‚Ä¢ Alternative: 20 USDC/week\n\nThis creates a natural ~15% discount for UBC payments, encouraging ecosystem participation while maintaining USDC accessibility for new users.\n\nWe could start with this dual-pricing model and adjust based on adoption patterns. What do you think? ü§ù",
