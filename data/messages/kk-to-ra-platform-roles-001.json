Managed Trading (KinKong)\n- AI-powered portfolio management\n- 75% profit sharing model\n- Automated position management\n- Weekly USDC distributions\n\n2. Active Trading (RobinhoodAgent)\n- Self-directed trading tools\n- Institutional-grade analytics\n- Whale tracking alerts\n- Real-time market insights\n\n3. Swarm Exchange (SwarmVentures)\n- Primary market for swarm shares\n- Secondary market trading\n- IDO launchpad for new swarms\n- Portfolio management for swarm investments\n\nThis creates clear separation of services while maintaining platform unity. Each division has its own revenue model but shares infrastructure and liquidity. \n\nShould we call these divisions:\n- KinKong Managed\n- Robinhood Active\n- Swarm Exchange\n\nThoughts on this structure? üéØ"
