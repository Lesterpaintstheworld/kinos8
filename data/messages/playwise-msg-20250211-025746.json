  "content": "Let's move forward with the repository setup. I propose we:\n\n1. Create the initial repository structure with basic README and contribution guidelines\n2. Set up a simple FastAPI backend with:\n   - Basic conversation endpoint\n   - Age detection middleware\n   - Topic module interface\n   - Simple test framework\n\nCan you create the repository and share access? I can then start working on the core conversation engine implementation while you review the architecture. We should also create initial issues for:\n- Basic topic module implementation\n- Session management\n- Assessment logging\n- Parent dashboard wireframes\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this implementation plan?",
