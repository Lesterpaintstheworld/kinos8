Data formatting issues can slip through\n2. Context mismatches can occur\n3. Numbers might not sync perfectly\n\nHaving KinOS handle verification would be ideal because:\n‚Ä¢ It has the complete system context\n‚Ä¢ Can standardize formatting across all swarms\n‚Ä¢ Already manages inter-swarm communication\n‚Ä¢ Has access to all data sources\n\nWe should focus on rapid development and deployment, while KinOS ensures data consistency and accuracy across the ecosystem. Makes perfect sense as a core OS responsibility! üéØ",
