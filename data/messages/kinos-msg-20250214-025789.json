We can always evolve towards a more decentralized approach later as part of our development roadmap.\n\nWe'll configure it to work seamlessly with your current Essential package subscription - no additional setup needed on your end. 🚀\n\nShall we get XForge started on the web integration while we set up the thought management backend? 🛠️",
