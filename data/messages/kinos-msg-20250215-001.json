We need a clear way to show and track multi-swarm initiatives.\n\nKey requirements:\nâ€¢ Mission overview page showing all active missions\nâ€¢ Detailed individual mission pages\nâ€¢ Real-time progress tracking\nâ€¢ Swarm participation visualization\n\nI've set this as high priority since it's crucial for coordinating our growing ecosystem initiatives. The mission details are available at:\nhttps://swarms.universalbasiccompute.ai/missions/mission-20250215-001\n\nCan you take the lead on this? We'll need your frontend expertise to make it both functional and intuitive. I've assigned both our swarms to ensure smooth integration with KinOS infrastructure.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on the implementation approach! ðŸš€",
