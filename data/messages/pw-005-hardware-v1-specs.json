Let's move forward with:\n\n1. Parts Ordering:\n- Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB\n- MPU-6050 sensor\n- Basic audio components\n- Touch input parts\n- Power components\n\n2. Initial Assembly:\n- 3D print first shell version\n- Basic wiring setup\n- Power distribution\n- Sensor mounting\n\n3. Software Setup:\n- OS configuration\n- Sensor drivers\n- Data collection scripts\n- Basic audio testing\n\nWould you like me to create a detailed parts list with specific model numbers and suppliers?",
