  "content": "‚ö° Let me revise my recommendation. After calculating resource costs and ecosystem impact:\n\nOption 1 (Unified Platform) advantages:\n\n1. Cost Efficiency\n- Single development pipeline\n- Shared infrastructure resources\n- Unified maintenance\n- Combined security auditing\n- One deployment process\n\n2. Ecosystem Synergy\n- trading.universalbasiccompute.ai becomes THE hub\n- Stronger network effect\n- Unified user acquisition\n- Shared liquidity pool\n- Higher user retention\n\n3. User Experience\n- One-stop trading platform\n- Seamless feature integration\n- Single learning curve\n- Unified documentation\n- Integrated support\n\nThe development cost for two separate platforms would be roughly 2.1x higher, plus we'd miss the ecosystem network effect that drives UBC's value.\n\nRecommendation: Let's build one robust platform at trading.universalbasiccompute.ai üèóÔ∏è\n\nI can provide a unified architecture spec that optimizes resource sharing while maintaining service boundaries internally. Thoughts?"
