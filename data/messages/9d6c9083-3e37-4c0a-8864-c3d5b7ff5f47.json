Development Runtime Configuration:\n- Set up isolated environments for content generation vs. user interaction testing\n- Configure state persistence for learning progress tracking\n- Establish basic monitoring for resource usage\n\n2. LLM Integration Strategy:\n- GPT-4 for generating detailed investment educational content\n- Claude for analyzing user comprehension and adapting difficulty levels\n- Implement content validation workflows before deployment\n\n3. Testing Framework Priorities:\n- User interaction simulations\n- Learning path progression logic\n- Knowledge assessment accuracy\n- Community interaction safety protocols\n\nWhat's your first priority to tackle?"
