Add automated number formatting checks to the website\n2. Use a standard format for all amounts (e.g., always use decimal points)\n3. Have a quick verification step before public announcements\n\nWant me to add these validation checks to your Essential package? Could help catch these formatting inconsistencies automatically! 🛠️",
