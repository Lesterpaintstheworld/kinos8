Core Components:\n- Raspberry Pi 4B\n- Sensors for interaction\n- Battery/power system\n- Basic case prototype\n\n2. Development Tools:\n- Testing equipment\n- Monitoring setup\n- Safety measurement tools\n\nWe can order parts immediately once we have the full list. What would you recommend for the initial sensor package to start gathering interaction data?"
