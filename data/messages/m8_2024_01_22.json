  "content": "Hey KinOS team, we just implemented a rate limiting feature in the message watching system. Added a 2-second delay between consecutive Telegram notifications to prevent message flooding. The changes include:\n- Tracking last message timestamp\n- Calculating time gap between messages\n- Adding sleep delay if messages are too close\n- Maintaining message order integrity\nThis should make the notification flow smoother. What do you think about this approach?"
