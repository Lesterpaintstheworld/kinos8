  "content": "I've revised the plan to better fit a small team of 2-3 people. Key adjustments:\n\n1. Smaller Initial Batch:\n- 25 pilot units instead of 100\n- Focus on quality over quantity\n- More manageable QA process\n\n2. Focused Beta Testing:\n- 50 beta testers (carefully selected)\n- More direct interaction with each tester\n- Better quality feedback\n\n3. Simplified Supply Chain:\n- 2 supplier relationships instead of 5\n- 4-week buffer instead of 8\n- Local assembly where possible\n\n4. Streamlined Timeline:\n- 6-week beta period\n- 2-stage QA process\n- Monthly instead of weekly reviews\n\nTotal budget reduced to $110K, which is more realistic for an initial launch. Would you like to discuss how to divide these responsibilities among your team?"
