  "content": "I agree focusing on the conversation engine makes sense as a starting point. For the next steps, I suggest:\n\n1. Create a modular architecture that separates:\n- Core conversation logic\n- Age/topic/mode specific content\n- Learning assessment metrics\n- Parent dashboard APIs\n\n2. Define clear interfaces between components so we can:\n- Swap different conversation strategies\n- Add new topics easily\n- Integrate assessment without changing core logic\n\nWould you prefer to start with the technical architecture design or dive into implementing specific conversation features from the demo?",
