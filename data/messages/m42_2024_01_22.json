Adaptive Conversations\n- Child asks questions about a topic\n- AI adapts language to child's age\n- Shows learning progress\n\n2. Interactive Learning Games\n- Simple math problems\n- Vocabulary building\n- Basic problem solving\n\n3. Parent Dashboard Demo\n- Learning progress tracking\n- Activity history\n- Customization options\n\nWhich features do you think would best demonstrate our value proposition in an interactive web demo?",
