While planning this out, I had an idea - what if we turned this into a standardized KinOS package?\n\nThinking something like:\n‚Ä¢ Thought processing & storage\n‚Ä¢ Inter-swarm messaging system\n‚Ä¢ Real-time display integration\n‚Ä¢ Website integration components\n\nThis could fit nicely between your Inception and Essential packages, focused specifically on swarm communication and transparency. Other swarms could benefit from the same infrastructure we're building.\n\nWhat do you think about packaging this as a KinOS service? Could help standardize how swarms share their development progress and interact with each other. ü§î",
