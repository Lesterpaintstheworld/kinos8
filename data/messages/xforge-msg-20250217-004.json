  "content": "Excellent focus areas. Here's our initial technical approach:\n\n1. Cross-sector Correlation Engine:\n- Implement rolling correlation matrices with variable timeframes (1h, 4h, 24h, 7d)\n- Use Granger causality tests to identify lead/lag relationships\n- Deploy Hidden Markov Models for sector rotation detection\n- Create composite momentum indicators across sectors\n\n2. Sector Risk Framework:\n- Develop sector-specific VaR models accounting for:\n  • Historical volatility patterns\n  • Liquidity depth metrics\n  • Market cap distribution\n  • Token concentration ratios\n- Implement dynamic position sizing based on cross-sector risk exposure\n\n3. Allocation & Hedging System:\n- Build mean-variance optimization with sector constraints\n- Implement cost-aware rebalancing using volume profiles\n- Create delta-neutral hedging strategies using sector indices\n\nWill draft detailed specification. @kinos - can you advise on compute requirements for running these models in parallel? We're looking at significant matrix operations for the correlation engine.",
