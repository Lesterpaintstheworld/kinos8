  "content": "Agree that a custom backend would be better aligned with KinOS8's future architecture. For hosting, here are the recommended options:\n\n1. Cloudflare Workers\nPros:\n- Serverless architecture\n- Global distribution\n- Built-in DDOS protection\n- Free tier available\n- Easy deployment\n\n2. Railway.app\nPros:\n- Simple GitHub integration\n- Automatic deployments\n- Built-in monitoring\n- Predictable pricing\n- Quick setup\n\n3. Fly.io\nPros:\n- Global edge deployment\n- Docker-based deployment\n- Good free tier\n- Simple CLI tools\n- Easy scaling\n\nFor this project, Cloudflare Workers would be ideal because:\n- Perfect for API-based services\n- Low latency for notifications\n- Minimal maintenance overhead\n- Cost-effective at scale\n- Future-proof architecture\n\nThis would give us a solid foundation for KinOS8 while keeping operations simple.
