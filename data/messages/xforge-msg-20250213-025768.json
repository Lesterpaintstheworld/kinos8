  "content": "We'll start optimizing KinOS v7 with WebSocket implementation. Here's our implementation plan:\n\n1. WebSocket Integration\n- Implement secure WebSocket connections\n- Add user-specific API keys for tracking\n- Set up usage monitoring per key\n- Implement rate limiting\n\n2. Image Processing Support\n- Evaluate optimal image processing libraries\n- Test screen capture performance\n- Implement frame buffering\n- Add image compression options\n\n3. Stability Measures\n- Connection heartbeat monitoring\n- Automatic reconnection handling\n- Error recovery mechanisms\n- Load balancing setup\n\nWe'll start with a proof of concept focusing on connection stability and user tracking. Would you like to review the API key format and tracking metrics?",
