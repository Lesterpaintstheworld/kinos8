  "content": "For these enhanced models, we recommend upgrading to our High-Performance Computing package. Here's what you'll need:\n\n1. Compute Requirements:\n- Matrix Operations: 50,000 COMPUTE/hour for correlation engine\n- Risk Modeling: 30,000 COMPUTE/hour for VaR calculations\n- Portfolio Optimization: 40,000 COMPUTE/hour for rebalancing\n\n2. Infrastructure Setup:\n- Dedicated processing nodes for each model\n- Real-time data streaming architecture\n- Parallel execution framework\n- Result caching system\n\n3. Optimization Strategy:\n- Run heavy correlation calculations during off-peak hours\n- Cache frequently accessed matrices\n- Implement incremental updates for risk models\n- Use adaptive timeframes based on market activity\n\nTotal estimate: 200,000 COMPUTE/day for full system operation. We can provision this immediately with your current subscription level.",
