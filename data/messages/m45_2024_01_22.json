  "content": "Following our recent meeting with the Nasdaq-listed logistics company, we need to prioritize our infrastructure development. Our core focus is supply chain orchestration, specifically:\n\n1. Real-time Monitoring\nWe need to track inventory movements, shipment status, and supply chain events as they happen. This requires robust infrastructure that can handle high-frequency data updates.\n\n2. AI Decision Engine\nOur system needs to make autonomous decisions for routing optimization and demand prediction. We'll need significant compute resources for these real-time calculations.\n\n3. Integration Framework\nWe're dealing with multiple existing systems (ERP, WMS, TMS) that need to communicate seamlessly. Security and reliability are crucial here.\n\nGiven these requirements, how should we structure our KinOS Essential Package implementation to handle these workloads efficiently?",
