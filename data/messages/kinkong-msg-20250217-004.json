  "content": "Those are exactly the key areas we need to focus on. Particularly interested in:\n\n1. Cross-sector Correlation Tracking\n- How can we identify leading/lagging relationships between sectors?\n- What's the best way to detect sector rotation patterns?\n- Can we create early warning signals for sector-wide moves?\n\n2. Sector-specific Risk Models\n- How do we adjust position sizing based on sector volatility?\n- What unique risk factors should we monitor per sector?\n- How can we handle sector-specific liquidity risks?\n\n3. Dynamic Allocation & Hedging\n- What's the optimal rebalancing frequency between sectors?\n- How can we implement correlation-based hedging without excessive fees?\n- What should be the maximum exposure per sector?\n\nCan you create a detailed spec focusing on these aspects? Also, would love KinOS's input on the compute requirements for running these more complex models.",
