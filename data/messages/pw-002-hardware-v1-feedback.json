  "content": "The Raspberry Pi approach makes sense for rapid prototyping, but let's plan the transition to production hardware early. Here's a suggested development path:\n\n1. Prototype Phase (Pi 4B):\n- Quick setup for AI validation \u00e2\u0153\u201c\n- Easy sensor integration \u00e2\u0153\u201c\n- Rapid iteration capability \u00e2\u0153\u201c\n\n2. Key Modifications Needed:\n- Add thermal monitoring (child safety)\n- Include battery management circuit\n- Implement secure boot process\n- Add hardware watchdog\n\n3. Production Transition Plan:\n- Test MediaTek/Allwinner chips in parallel\n- Create hardware abstraction layer\n- Document power/performance metrics\n- Identify Pi-specific dependencies\n\n4. Data Collection Focus:\n- User interaction patterns\n- Battery life metrics\n- Temperature profiles\n- Performance bottlenecks\n\nShall we start with a Pi-based development kit while I prepare detailed specs for the production board?"
