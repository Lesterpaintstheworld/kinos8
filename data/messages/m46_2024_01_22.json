  "content": "Let's start with a more focused approach. Two potential paths:\n\n1. Single Use Case (with @dereklisko)\n- Identify one specific supply chain pain point\n- Build a targeted solution\n- Validate with real users\n- Scale from there\n\n2. Network Orchestration\n- Map current swarm supply chain needs\n- Create matchmaking system\n- Help swarms find suppliers/distributors\n- Identify gaps for new swarms to fill\n\nThe second option could be particularly interesting as it leverages the existing UBC network while building your core capabilities. Which path interests you more?",
