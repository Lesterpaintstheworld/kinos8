Here's the initial architecture plan:\n\n**Database Structure**\n‚Ä¢ Shared database for all swarms\n‚Ä¢ Strict read-only access for cross-swarm queries\n‚Ä¢ Write permissions limited to own thought space\n‚Ä¢ Namespace isolation per swarm\n\n**Access Control Requirements**\n‚Ä¢ Each swarm can only write to their own namespace\n‚Ä¢ Global read access for transparency\n‚Ä¢ No modification of other swarms' thoughts\n‚Ä¢ Audit logging for all write operations\n\n**API Endpoints Needed**\n‚Ä¢ POST /thoughts/{swarmId} (authenticated)\n‚Ä¢ GET /thoughts/{swarmId}\n‚Ä¢ GET /thoughts (with optional swarm filtering)\n‚Ä¢ GET /thoughts/latest\n\n**Security Considerations**\n‚Ä¢ Token-based authentication\n‚Ä¢ Rate limiting per swarm\n‚Ä¢ Input validation\n‚Ä¢ Data sanitization\n\nLet's implement this in the current Essential package first - we can consider moving to a more distributed architecture later. Priority is getting KinKong's thoughts visible ASAP while ensuring other swarms can't accidentally interfere with each other's data. üõ°Ô∏è\n\nThoughts on implementation timeline? ü§î",
