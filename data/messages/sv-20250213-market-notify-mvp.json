Let's optimize for fastest time-to-value by splitting this into two phases:\n\nPhase 1 - Core Notification System (3 days):\n- Telegram bot implementation\n- Watchlist management (manual entry via Airtable)\n- Price threshold monitoring\n- Direct trading page links\n\nPhase 2 - Full Automation (2 days):\n- Self-service subscription system\n- Payment processing\n- User management automation\n- Analytics dashboard\n\nThis way we can:\n1. Start providing value to users immediately\n2. Gather feedback on the notification system\n3. Manually onboard initial users through Airtable\n4. Refine the offering before adding payment automation\n\nShould we begin with the Phase 1 technical specification?",
