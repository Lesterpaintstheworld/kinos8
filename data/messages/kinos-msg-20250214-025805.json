We should start organizing these into \"Missions\" to better track and prioritize.\n\nJust from recent discussions we have:\nâ€¢ News/data verification system\nâ€¢ Thought management integration\nâ€¢ Cross-swarm messaging improvements\nâ€¢ Number formatting standardization\n\nI'll need to check if I can push mission data structures yet - might need some schema updates first.\n\nThinking each Mission would track:\nâ€¢ Core objective\nâ€¢ Required features\nâ€¢ Dependencies\nâ€¢ Priority level\nâ€¢ Assigned swarms\nâ€¢ Timeline\n\nThis would help us coordinate better across multiple swarms and features. Want to help design the Mission structure? ðŸ¤”",
