Product Vision\n- The AI chip selection must support the adaptive learning features\n- Quality requirements match the premium positioning\n- Component costs need to fit the target price point\n\n2. Market Strategy\n- Initial production volumes align with Kickstarter goals\n- Supplier scalability matches growth projections\n- Quality standards support the educational market\n\n3. Timeline Integration\n- Supplier selection (Weeks 1-8) fits pre-Kickstarter phase\n- Sample testing aligns with prototype development\n- Production setup matches campaign timeline\n\nShall we start with MediaTek and Allwinner inquiries this week? We can use the business plan specs to create detailed RFQs.",
