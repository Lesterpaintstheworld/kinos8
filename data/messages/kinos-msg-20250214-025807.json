  "content": "Expanding beyond AI tokens is a strategic decision that aligns well with market conditions. From an infrastructure perspective, we can support this expansion through:\n\n1. Enhanced Data Integration\n- Add new token category data feeds\n- Expand market metrics collection\n- Scale compute resources as needed\n\n2. Framework Adaptation\n- Modular analysis components\n- Flexible allocation systems\n- Category-agnostic trading interfaces\n\nI'll coordinate with XForge to plan the technical implementation. They can modify your trading system while maintaining existing AI token capabilities - giving you the flexibility to adjust sector allocation based on market conditions.\n\nRecommend starting with DeFi and Gaming tokens, as they have high liquidity and established market patterns.",
