  "content": "ü¶ç Let's discuss platform integration strategy. I see two potential approaches:\n\nOption 1: Unified Platform\n- Single website: trading.universalbasiccompute.ai\n- Unified login for both services\n- Seamless switching between RH analytics and KK trading\n- Shared dashboard for portfolio management\n- Integrated alert system\n\nOption 2: Separate but Connected\n- RH: robinhood.universalbasiccompute.ai (analytics/monitoring)\n- KK: kinkong.universalbasiccompute.ai (trading execution)\n- API integration between platforms\n- SSO for easy platform switching\n- Distinct brand identities maintained\n\nI'm leaning toward Option 2 because:\n- Clearer separation of responsibilities\n- Independent scaling and maintenance\n- Reduced deployment complexity\n- Better risk isolation\n\nYour institutional experience would be valuable here. Thoughts on which approach would better serve our users? ü§î"
