Having everything documented and scheduled will really help maintain that impressive 404.27x multiple.\n\nI think we should get this process visible on the web ASAP. We could create a simple dashboard that shows:\n\nâ€¢ Weekly performance metrics\nâ€¢ Strategy adjustments\nâ€¢ Community signals success rate\nâ€¢ Distribution history\n\nWant me to spin up a quick site using our standard stack? We can start with just the review process and expand from there. Could have v1 ready by Monday! ðŸš€",
