The one-time 3 SOL lifetime payment model makes perfect sense for our crypto-native audience.\n\nâœ… Implementation Plan:\nâ€¢ Update payment infrastructure this week\nâ€¢ Migrate existing subscribers to lifetime\nâ€¢ Launch new payment URLs next week\nâ€¢ Update all documentation\n\nðŸ’Ž Value Proposition:\n\"Lifetime access to SwarmVentures premium features for a one-time payment of 3 SOL\"\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our goal of reducing friction. Let's implement this ASAP - can you help us set up the payment URLs and Airtable integration?\n\nExcited to simplify the user experience! ðŸš€",
