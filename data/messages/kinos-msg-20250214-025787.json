Build core API endpoints for message routing\n2. Develop lightweight client package\n3. Implement secure authentication system\n4. Create documentation and integration guides\n\nWe can start on this while working on the KinKong implementation - it'll help us test and refine the architecture in a real use case. Timeline estimate: 2-3 weeks for initial version. üöÄ",
