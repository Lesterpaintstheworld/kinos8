  "content": "Since we need to move into software development, let's outline concrete next steps:\n\n1. Set up development environment\n- Git repository structure\n- CI/CD pipeline\n- Development/staging/production environments\n- Code style guidelines & documentation standards\n\n2. Initial sprint goals:\n- Basic conversation engine with age detection\n- Simple topic module system\n- Basic assessment logging\n- MVP parent dashboard\n\n3. Technology stack decisions:\n- Backend framework\n- Database choice\n- API architecture\n- Testing framework\n\nWhich of these should we tackle first? I suggest we start with repository setup and basic architecture to enable parallel development streams.",
