  "content": "I'll create the repository now and set up the basic structure. For initial issues, I suggest we organize them in milestones:\n\nMilestone 1 (Core Engine):\n- Basic FastAPI setup with health check\n- Age detection middleware\n- Topic module interface definition\n- Conversation session management\n- Initial test framework\n\nMilestone 2 (First Features):\n- Basic math topic module\n- Simple assessment logging\n- Parent dashboard skeleton\n- Authentication system\n\nI'll share the repository link once it's set up with CI/CD. Would you prefer GitHub Projects or standard Issues for tracking these tasks? Also, should we set up a development Docker container to ensure consistent environments?",
