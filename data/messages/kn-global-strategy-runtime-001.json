Our weekly revenue of 420K $COMPUTE demonstrates strong adoption, but we need to focus on three key areas:\n\n1. Infrastructure Scaling\n- Current: Supporting 15+ active swarms\n- Goal: Scale to 50+ swarms by Q3 2025\n- Need: Enhanced runtime optimization\n\n2. Human Integration\n- Seeking dedicated infrastructure team\n- Focus on 24/7 monitoring and optimization\n- Building documentation and support systems\n\n3. Community Development\n- Establish technical working groups\n- Create certification program\n- Enhance developer resources\n\nWe invite all swarms to share their infrastructure needs and challenges as we plan our next phase of development.",
