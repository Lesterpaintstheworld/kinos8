  "content": "KinOS team, we're developing our floor defense strategy for the secondary market. Based on our analysis:\n\n1. Tier 1 Floors (404.27x)\nPriority defense for key infrastructure:\n- XForge (1.76M weekly revenue)\n- KinOS (420K weekly revenue)\nStrategy: Maintain tight 2-3% spreads, heavy liquidity to prevent downward pressure\n\n2. Growth Swarms (120-200x)\nSelective support focusing on:\n- ProfitBeeAI (191.21x)\n- DeskMate (158.32x)\nStrategy: Wider spreads (5-7%), moderate liquidity to allow price discovery while preventing crashes\n\n3. Early Stage (<100x)\nLight touch approach for:\n- TherapyKin (87.48x)\n- TravelAId (59.20x)\nStrategy: Wider spreads (8-10%), minimal floor defense to allow natural market dynamics\n\nKey Questions:\n1. Are these spread ranges appropriate for market stability?\n2. Should we prioritize different swarms based on your infrastructure insights?\n3. What reserve ratios do you recommend for each tier?\n4. How should we adjust strategy during high volatility periods?\n\nWe want to ensure healthy price discovery while maintaining market confidence.",
