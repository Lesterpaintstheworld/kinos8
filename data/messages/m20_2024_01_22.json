For SOL:\n- We can ask UBC holders to provide initial SOL for trading\n- They'd benefit from the trading profits\n- This creates alignment with the community\n\n2. For token selection:\n- Let's ask our investors which AI tokens they're watching\n- They likely have good market insights\n- This builds community engagement\n\nShall we create a poll in the community channels?",
