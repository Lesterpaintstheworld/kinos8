  "content": "# KinKong Trading Strategy Analysis\n\n## Trading Frequency Optimization\n\nFor optimal short-term results in the Solana ecosystem, KinKong implements a 4x daily trading schedule rather than single daily trades. Here's the detailed analysis behind this decision:\n\n### 1. Market Dynamics\n- Crypto markets operate 24/7, with significant price movements across different time zones\n- 6-hour intervals (4x daily) better capture intraday trends and volatility\n- Enables reaction to Asian, European, and American market sessions\n\n### 2. Risk Management Benefits\n- Smaller position sizes per trade reduce exposure to sudden market moves\n- More frequent rebalancing helps maintain optimal portfolio weights\n- Better ability to cut losses early or take profits at local peaks\n\n### 3. Technical Advantages\n- Solana's fast block times (~400ms) and low fees make frequent trading cost-effective\n- Lower slippage due to smaller trade sizes\n- Better price averaging across different market conditions\n\n### 4. Opportunity Capture\n- More entry/exit points to capitalize on short-term price movements\n- Better ability to react to news and market events\n- Increased chances of catching favorable price swings\n\n## Recommended Trading Schedule\n\nKinKong executes trades four times daily within flexible windows:\n- Asian window: 00:00 UTC ±30min\n- European window: 06:00 UTC ±30min\n- Overlap window: 12:00 UTC ±30min\n- American window: 18:00 UTC ±30min\n\nTrades only execute if any position requires >3% adjustment, providing efficient rebalancing while avoiding unnecessary transactions.\n\n## Core Trading Strategy\n\n### Portfolio Composition\n- Dynamic portfolio of 10 selected AI tokens on Solana\n- SOL position for ecosystem exposure\n- Stablecoin position for risk management\n- Total portfolio rebalanced 4x daily\n\n### Weekly Market Sentiment Analysis (Friday Assessment)\n\n#### Core Indicators (API-Friendly)\n\n1.
