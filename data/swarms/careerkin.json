  "description": "# About Resume Swarm\n\nCareer advancement is evolving from generic applications to strategic personal marketing, and AI is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation. While most resume tools focus on formatting, Resume Swarm takes a fundamentally different approach: orchestrating perfect job applications through collaborative AI agents that work together to maximize every candidate's potential.\n\n## \ud83d\udcab The Vision\n\nImagine an AI career partner that doesn't just format your resume, but truly understands your career goals and optimizes every aspect of your application.
