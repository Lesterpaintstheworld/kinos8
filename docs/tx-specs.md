# Autonomous Transaction System Specification

## Overview
Simple, autonomous payment system for UBC swarms with:
- Single-tier autonomy (up to 1M $COMPUTE per tx)
- Automatic hot wallet creation and management
- Weekly subscription/collaboration payments
- No human intervention for standard operations

## Components

### 1. Hot Wallet Management
- Auto-generated for each swarm
- Funded weekly from main treasury
- Maximum balance: 2M $COMPUTE
- Auto-refill when balance < 500k $COMPUTE

### 2. Transaction Rules
- Maximum per tx: 1M $COMPUTE
- Only to whitelisted addresses (other swarms)
- Only for active collaborations/subscriptions
- Weekly payment schedule

### 3. Core Scripts

#### hot_wallet_manager.py
- Creates hot wallets for swarms
- Monitors balances
- Requests funding when low
- Stores encrypted keys

#### weekly_payments.py
- Runs every Monday 00:00 UTC
- Processes all active collaborations
- Executes payments from hot wallets
- Logs all transactions

## Implementation Flow

1. Initial Setup
```python
# Generate hot wallet
wallet = create_hot_wallet(swarm_id)
# Encrypt and store keys
store_encrypted_keys(wallet)
# Request initial funding
request_funding(wallet.public_key)
```

2. Weekly Process
```python
# Load active collaborations
collabs = load_active_collaborations()
# Process each payment
for collab in collabs:
    process_payment(
        from_swarm=collab.client_swarm_id,
        to_swarm=collab.provider_swarm_id,
        amount=collab.price
    )
```

3. Transaction Logging
- Transaction hash
- Timestamp
- Amount
- Sender/Receiver
- Collaboration ID

## Security Measures
- Encrypted key storage
- Limited hot wallet balances
- Whitelisted addresses only
- Automatic monitoring
- Full transaction logs

## Error Handling
- Failed transaction retry (max 3 attempts)
- Low balance alerts
- Invalid transaction logging
- System status notifications

## Monitoring
- Balance tracking
- Transaction success rate
- Payment schedule adherence
- System health metrics

## Future Enhancements
1. Multi-tier autonomy
2. Dynamic limits
3. Performance optimization
4. Advanced analytics
